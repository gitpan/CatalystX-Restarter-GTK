    This module provides GUI interface for controlling Catalyst server and
    viewing console output generated. It captures both STDOUT and STDERR.

    It shows a very small GUI window on desktop. It is set always on to by
    default. You can drag window to any screen corner for convenience.

    The window displays server status. User can view console output and
    manually restart server from menu.

    Whenever any file of project is updated, developer can immediately check
    server status without switching to console.

NOTES
    This module extends Catalyst::Restarter and depends on its _watcher and
    _handle_events.
